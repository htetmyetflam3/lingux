/**
 * FILE: logen/selftest.js
 *
 * THE SUITE, RUN AT BOOT, BY LOGEN, WHEN LOGGING IS ON.
 *
 * So `npm test` is not a separate step for the site: start the server with
 * checks on and the suite runs in this process, before the first request,
 * and reports through the same logger as everything else.
 *
 * WHAT CAN MOVE HERE, AND WHAT CANNOT
 *
 * Measured, not guessed. Of the 103 tests in this repository:
 *
 *   PURE -- no database, no listening socket. They construct their own
 *   input and assert on a return value. Every backend test of that kind,
 *   and the parser's whole suite, runs here.
 *
 *   NOT PURE -- creates a real sqlite file (cookieQuota, cookieUpsert, db,
 *   migrate) or boots a server and makes requests (engineQueue,
 *   engineRoundtrip, curlOffPath). Running those at boot would mean a
 *   server that writes scratch databases and binds extra ports on startup,
 *   which is worse than running them separately. They stay in `npm test`.
 *
 * So this is not "the test suite moved into the server". It is the half
 * that can honestly run anywhere, run automatically, plus the live chain
 * checks in core.js that cover real traffic. The other 47 still belong to
 * `npm test`, and the boot summary says so rather than implying coverage
 * it does not have.
 *
 * The files are NOT duplicated. This runs the same .test.js files the npm
 * script runs, through node:test's programmatic runner, so there is one
 * owner for every assertion.
