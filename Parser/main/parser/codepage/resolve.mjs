/**
 * FILE: Parsed/parser/codepage/resolve.mjs
 *
 * THE FRONT DOOR OF THE CODEPAGE LAYER. Nothing outside codepage/ calls
 * registry/names/vote directly -- it asks here, and gets one answer.
 *
 * A "code page" here is NOT page layout. It is one table:
 *
 *     byte code in the PDF content stream  ->  Myanmar text
 *
 * Legacy Burmese PDFs ship a font whose bytes mean whatever that foundry
 * decided, so the same byte is a different letter in every family. Picking the
 * wrong table is what turns readable Burmese into rubbish, so the choice is
 * made once, here, and scored.
 *
 * Two ways in, one way out:
 *
 *   prepareVectorLayout()  GATE + BUILD. Cheap PDF-structure check first: a
 *                          document with no legacy font never loads a witness
 *                          corpus and never reads an outline. Only if the gate
 *                          opens does vector-repair.mjs build a candidate table
 *                          from the embedded fonts' own outlines (text path 5).
 *
 *   chooseCodePage()       SCORE + PICK. Every registered table (and the voted
 *                          candidate, if one was built) decodes the first few
 *                          pages; the Burmese score decides. A table that
 *                          produces fewer than 50 marks scores 0, so a lucky
 *                          short match cannot win.
 *
 * Both were inline in pipeline.mjs. Assembly should not also be deciding; that
 * is why they live here now. Logic is unchanged.
