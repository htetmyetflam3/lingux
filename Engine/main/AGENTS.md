## important 

This brach overlap with the *staging engine* from *dev* from development 
However  *bridge.js* in this brach hightlight the differences.

----

## Exclude 
- Reading code under Lexic_No_inspect/*
- generic software advice
- long tutorials or exhaustive file trees
- obvious language conventions
- speculative claims or anything you could not verify
- content better stored in another file *reference*


## Avoid
- finding errors in Lexic_No_inspect/*
- creating test files in root
- techanical jargon in architecture questions and  explainations 
- Do not ask about anything the repo already makes clear.

-----

## Warn
- undocumented conventions
- missing setup or test prerequisites that are known but not written down
  

## Rules

- Prefer executable sources of truth over prose. If docs conflict with config or scripts, trust the executable source and only keep what you can verify.
- One task at a time. Do not start the next one.
-  verified with the result .Do not reason and call it verified.
- Say what you could **not** verify, and flag anything you added unasked.
- Ask architecture questions plainly
- Keep reusable scripts in `./.bin
-  squeeze commits ,  CHANGELOG.md update  must done before PR
- Append** a new dated entry in changelog.md update
